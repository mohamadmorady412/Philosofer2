A **flexible, modular, and extensible server framework** designed to build complex, logic-driven microservice architectures — like LEGO bricks.

This project provides a set of reusable libraries and inference mechanisms that dynamically compose runtime behavior from declarative modules. It is ideal for building **intelligent, pluggable services** that can evolve over time without tightly coupled dependencies.

 

## 🚀 Overview

At its core, the framework is:

- **Modular** – Logic and functionality are broken into well-defined, reusable modules.
- **Composable** – Modules can be combined like building blocks, allowing you to define high-level server behavior declaratively.
- **Logic-driven** – A first-order inference engine reads your manifest file and connects modules accordingly.
- **Microservice-friendly** – Designed to integrate cleanly into distributed, scalable systems.

 

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Make it easy to define server behavior using configuration and logic, not code duplication.
- ✅ Enable **plug-and-play** service design: add or remove features via manifest files.
- ✅ Support **inference-based module wiring** using declarative logic and rules.
- ✅ Facilitate testing, extension, and reuse of components in various server contexts.

 

## 🧩 How It Works

### 1. **Modules**

Each unit of logic or behavior (e.g., authentication, data routing, transformation) is implemented as an isolated, reusable module with a defined input/output schema.

### 2. **Manifest File**

A central manifest (`manifest.yaml` or `.json`) describes:

- Module dependencies
- Wiring rules
- Execution flows
- Environment-specific overrides

### 3. **Inference Engine**

A **first-order inference engine** reads the manifest and intelligently connects modules at runtime. It ensures the right sequence, configuration, and integration for the intended behavior.

### 4. **Runtime Composition**

Modules are dynamically connected and executed in a pipeline to form a working server — fully based on the logic and structure defined in the manifest.

 

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Dynamic API generation and routing
- Composable microservices with logic-level control
- Pluggable backend architecture for AI/ML pipelines
- Flexible event-driven systems

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/modular-server
cd modular-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server/main.py --manifest manifest/example.yaml
```

 

## 📜 Example Manifest

```yaml
modules:
  - name: AuthModule
    config:
      strategy: JWT
  - name: RouteModule
    depends_on: [AuthModule]
    config:
      routes:
        - path: /user
          handler: UserHandler

logic_rules:
  - if: AuthModule.output.valid
    then: RouteModule.activate
```

 

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

 A project to bring more people together


## handellers

For example, it is supposed to serve and manage ports for communicating with library services, such as those inside each node.

        from folder, cdn or another methods.

## hpc

Hardware power check

It works specifically on middleware and its first-order logic algorithms and blocks any "desirable" before applying
it if the time/space cost is deemed too high. It interacts with the second type.

In the second phase, if an architecture is created based on "desirable", it checks in stages whether the performance
of the entire module is appropriate or not.


## midelware

There is a middleware that makes the "desirable"
It uses first-order logic.
