It works specifically on middleware and its first-order logic algorithms and blocks any "desirable" before applying
it if the time/space cost is deemed too high. It interacts with the second type.

In the second phase, if an architecture is created based on "desirable", it checks in stages whether the performance
of the entire module is appropriate or not.
